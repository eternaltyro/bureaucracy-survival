### Rent Receipt Tips
- If rent paid by tenant per month exceeds Rs. 1,00,000 per year, then
  the property owners' PAN Card must be mentioned in the Rent Receipt.
  Fearing income-tax, property owners in many places refuse to make
  formal binding agreements mentioning the 'actual' rent they charge for
  the property. Finding honest tax-paying property owners is in your
  best interests.

- For reasons mentioned above, rent receipts are capped at Rs. 8,300 per
  month which amounts to Rs. 99,600 per year. Also, rent receipts are
  forged by the tenants - who are themselves income-tax assessees(?) -
  at the time of filing income-tax returns.

- If you plan to forge the receipts after all, here are some tips:
 - An authentic looking "Receipt Number" or "Receipt ID" lends.. um..
   authenticity to the receipt.
 - You can make receipts for every quarter. One receipt for three months
   should suffice. No need to waste 12 papers when four would do.
 - Typically, 1. Apr-Jun; 2. Jul-Sep; 3. Oct-Dec; 4. Jan-Mar. Mention that Rent
   has been paid in advance wherever appropriate.
 - Each receipt should have a revenue stamp of 1 rupee value affixed.
 - The property owner's signature should begin on paper and ride across
   the revenue stamp.
 - The date on the receipt should match the beginning of the month range
   mentioned in it. It's considered normal to have paid your rent in
   advance.
 - The name of the tenant and the address of the property should be
   clearly mentioned leaving no room for ambiguity.
 - The name of the property owner and address should be mentioned.
 - Standard honorifics like Shri. / Smt. / Kum. / Mr. / Miss. and Mrs.
   can be used as you see fit. Smt. and Mrs. are for married women. Kum.
   and Miss. are for unmarried women.
 - Mr. and Shri are for men irrespective of marital status because of
   prevailing retrograde patriarchal society in India.

### Forging Signatures

- Do not forge signatures. Your property owner should not have problems
  signing across a revenue stamp as long as her/his PAN card number does
  not feature in the rent receipt.
- If your property owner has no problems signing receipts even with her
  PAN number mentioned, then congratulations!
- If you *do* forge the signature, follow these tips:
 - Sign consistently across receipts. Practice is key!
 - Do not sign with green or red ink. Use only Blue or Black ink.
 - Sign beginning from just left of the revenue stamp riding across the
   stamp. If the stamp is removed, part of the signature should be
   missing.
 - Get some willing accomplice to sign your rent receipts and return the
   favor or pay the favor forward!
 - For inspiration, look at a famous (deceased) personality's Wikipedia
   page for signature samples. Lincoln's signature is too neat. FDR's
   sign is stylish. But Gandhi's looks the best suited.

Long live Indian bureaucracy!!!
